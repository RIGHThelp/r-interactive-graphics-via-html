Description: RIGHT enables interactive data visualization and analysis using
    HTML5 canvas and JavaScript technology to help users easily explore data
    and gain valuable insight. Its R API is designed to create a seamless
    analysis-visualization workflow for interactive graphics. Since HTML5
    canvas and JavaScript is supported in virtually all modern web browsers,
    the visualizations can be delivered to almost any device/platform for
    presentation purposes.
